We have some konjac noodles that have been sitting in the fridge for a long time. I want to try this recipe to use them.

## Ingredients
- 1 pack of konjac noodles (shirataki noodles), drained and rinsed
- 1 block (about 14 oz) firm tofu, drained, pressed, and cut into cubes
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil (divided)
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil (vegetable or canola) for stir-frying
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 3-4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch piece fresh ginger, minced
- 6 oz white mushrooms, sliced
- 2 small heads of bok choy, chopped (or 1 large)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari for gluten-free)
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar or lime juice
- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil (for finishing)
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)
- 1 tablespoon water (to help the stir-fry along if needed)
- 2-3 tablespoons chopped green onions (for garnish)
- A handful of roasted cashews or peanuts (optional, for crunch)

## Process
1. **Prepare the tofu**:  
   Press the tofu to remove excess water. Cut the tofu into cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon of neutral oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tofu cubes in a single layer and cook for about 3-4 minutes until golden and crispy on the bottom. Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
   
2. **Prepare the konjac noodles**:  
   Rinse the konjac noodles under warm water and drain thoroughly. Set aside.

3. **Stir-fry the aromatics and vegetables**:  
   In the same pan, add the sesame oil (1 tablespoon) and heat over medium-high heat. Add the sliced red onion and cook for 1-2 minutes until softened. Add the garlic and ginger, stir-frying for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes until they release their moisture and brown.

4. **Combine the ingredients**:  
   Add the bok choy to the pan and stir-fry for another 2 minutes. Add the drained konjac noodles and cooked tofu. Toss gently to mix.

5. **Season the stir-fry**:  
   Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar (or lime juice), and sugar (if using). Stir well and add a tablespoon of water if needed. Stir in the toasted sesame oil and red pepper flakes (if using).

6. **Finish and serve**:  
   Garnish with chopped green onions and optional cashews or peanuts. Serve hot, either on its own or with rice.

Enjoy your flavorful and healthy stir-fry!
