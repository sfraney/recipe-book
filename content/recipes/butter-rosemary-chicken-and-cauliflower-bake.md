Butter-Rosemary Chicken and Cauliflower Bake

## Ingredients

- 1.25 lb. bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 10 oz. riced cauliflower
- 10 oz. green beans, trimmed and cut if large
- 3 tbsp butter, divided
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1½ tsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped
  - or ¾ tsp dried rosemary, crushed
- ½ cup low-sodium chicken stock
- Salt and black pepper
- Olive oil (small amount)

## Preparation

1. Heat oven to 375°F.

1. Season chicken thighs generously with salt, pepper, and about one-third of the rosemary.

1. In a skillet over medium heat, add a little olive oil and brown the chicken skin-side down until the skin is well rendered and golden, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip briefly, then remove. You’re not cooking through.

### Casserole base
  1. In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium-low. Add 2 tbsp butter.
  1. Add garlic and remaining rosemary. Cook just until fragrant, 30 seconds.
  1. Stir in riced cauliflower and green beans. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
  1. Add chicken stock and cook 3 to 4 minutes to take the raw edge off and let the cauliflower absorb flavor.

### Assemble
  1. Transfer the vegetable mixture to a lightly buttered casserole dish and spread evenly.
  1. Nestle chicken thighs on top, skin side up.
  1. Dot the remaining 1 tbsp butter around the dish.

### Bake
  1. Cover loosely with foil and bake 25 minutes.
  1. Uncover and bake another 15 to 20 minutes, until chicken is cooked through and the top is lightly browned.
  1. If you want crisper skin, finish with 3 to 5 minutes under the broiler.

## Notes

- This stays intentionally light and roast-like rather than creamy.
- If you want a touch more richness without cheese, a spoon or two of cream stirred into the cauliflower before baking works well.
