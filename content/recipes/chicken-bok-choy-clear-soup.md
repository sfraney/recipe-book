# Chicken and Bok Choy Clear Soup (Serves 4)

A light, brothy soup that is diabetic-friendly, nightshade-free, and low in potassium. Perfect for a savory, protein-rich dinner.

## Ingredients

- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (12–16 oz total)
- 6 cups water (or low-sodium chicken stock for extra flavor)
- 2 inches fresh ginger, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, lightly crushed
- ¼ cup red onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cups cabbage, chopped
- 2 cups bok choy, chopped (separate stems and leaves)
- Salt, to taste
- Optional: 2 tsp soy sauce
- Optional: ½ cup finely chopped rehydrated dried mushrooms
- Optional garnish: a few drops of sesame oil

## Method

1. **Prep the chicken**
   Slice the chicken breasts thinly across the grain for even cooking and tenderness.

2. **Build the broth**
   In a medium-large saucepan, combine water (or stock), ginger, garlic, and red onion.
   Bring to a gentle simmer, avoid hard boiling.

3. **Cook the chicken**
   Add the sliced chicken to the simmering broth.
   Simmer gently for ~5 minutes, until not fully cooked. Skim any foam for clarity.

4. **Add vegetables**
   Add cabbage and bok choy stems first; simmer 2–3 minutes.
   Add bok choy leaves and cook 30–60 seconds until just wilted.

5. **Season**
   Taste and adjust salt, or optionally add low-sodium soy sauce.
   Remove ginger and garlic slices if you prefer a very clear broth.

6. **Serve**
   Divide evenly into bowls, ensuring chicken and vegetables are distributed.
   Optionally, drizzle a few drops of sesame oil for aroma.

## Tips / Variations

- **For extra umami:** add finely chopped rehydrated dried mushrooms to the broth when simmering.
- **Make-ahead:** cook the chicken and broth separately, store cooled, and add vegetables fresh when reheating.
- **Serving:** perfect as a light lunch or dinner; pairs well with a side of low-carb grain or salad if desired.
