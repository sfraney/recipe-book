This recipe doesn't really work...

## Ingredients
- 6 eggs
- 1 packet ramen noodles
- 0.5 lbs. thin sliced brisket
- 3 medium white mushrooms
- 1/2 medium onion, diced
- Salt & Pepper

## Process
1. Beat eggs in a bowl
1. Heat 1 T vegetable oil in saute pan over medium-high heat until shimmering, add mushrooms, saute until almost all liquid is evaporated
1. Meanwhile, cook ramen noodles according to package directions
1. Add diced onions when mushrooms have emitted most of their moisture, saute until softened, but not browned, about 5 minutes
1. Quickly fry brisket in pan with onions and mushrooms, pushing them to the side to make room
1. Allow mushroom, onion, and brisket mixture cool slightly (~5 minutes) then add to beaten eggs
1. Heat 1 T vegetable oil in nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron over medium heat, when the oil is shimmering, add egg mixture.  Do not disturb until sides begin to dry out, 5 - 10 minutes.
1. Either carefully turn egg pancake onto a plate and then return to pan to finish cooking the bottom, or place under broiler in oven for ~5 minutes until second side it set.
1. Remove to cutting board and slice like a pizza.
1. Serve with optional green onion garnish and vinegar/soy sauce dipping sauce (50/50 mix).
