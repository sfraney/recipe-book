## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 2 T Apple Cider Vinegar
- 4 t Lemon Juice
- 4 t Apple Juice
- 1 t powdered garlic
- 1 t prepared horseradish (either in vinegar or creamy)
- 1 t coarsely ground black pepper
- 1/2 t mustard powder
- 1 big pinch coarse diamond crystal kosher salt
- dash cayenne pepper
- 3 chicken thighs

## Process

1. Prepare sauce by mixing all ingredients (except the chicken) in a bowl. Refrigerate for a couple hours to let all the flavors mingle.
1. Season chicken with freshly ground black pepper and kosher salt. Give salt 40+ minutes to penetrate and do its magic.
1. Prepare grill for 2-zone cooking, shooting for 325° F on the cool side. Add wood when 325° F is achieved and give a couple minutes with the lid on to accumulate some clean smoke (i.e., light blue tinge).
1. Heat chicken to 155° F, skin side up, on cool side
1. Flip chicken to skin side down, heat to 165°
1. Coat chicken in prepared sauce, heat to 170°. This allows the sauce to bake on to the outside of the chicken.
1. Remove chicken and let rest 5 – 10 minutes, coat again with BBQ sauce. This allows the sauce to stick and not just run off.

## Impressions

This was very good. Hearty thumbs up from all at the table along with requests to add this to the recipe list (i.e., this blog). We’ll definitely have to do it again.

## Modifications

I used the garlic powder as directed, even though we were pretty low. We tend to use fresh garlic and I think this sauce would be fine with fresh garlic through a press.
