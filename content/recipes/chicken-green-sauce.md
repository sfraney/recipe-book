## Ingredients

- 2 lbs. chicken drumsticks & thighs – skin removed
- 3 lbs. husked tomatillos
- 6 cloves garlic
- 2 serrano chiles
- 1 bunch cilantro
- Handful of scallions, chopped

## Process

1. Place tomatillos, garlic, and serranos in boiling water for 2 minutes, drain
1. While warm, blend with the juice and zest of 3 limes and 1 bunch cilantro, season generously with salt
1. Braise chicken in sauce for 25 minutes
1. Finish with juice of 1 lime and garnish with handful of chopped scallions

## Impressions

Meh, it was fine. The sauce was much better as a salsa. I ate the leftover with tortilla chips and it was pretty great, though it honestly would have been better – especially after a day in the fridge – if it didn’t have the chicken fat in it.

There wasn’t much synergy between the chicken and the sauce like I’d hoped. It was really just chicken with green salsa on it.
