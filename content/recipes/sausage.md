I've liked homemade sausages, but not as much as the best ones I've bought. I think I just need to iterate on the seasonings. Starting from the basic recipes in [The Food Lab](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_Food_Lab_Better_Home_Cooking_Through/g-9wBgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover), I'm going to iterate on italian sausage and bratwurst recipes. I think I'll leave the italian sausage loose while I'll put the brats in some casings.

I bought a ~7 lb. pork shoulder yesterday to try this iteration.

# First Iteration

### Process (identical between two)
1. Combine the meat, salt, and seasonings in a large bowl and toss until homogeneous. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 24.
1. Place the feed tube, shaft, plates, die, and blade of the grinder in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Then attach the grinder to your mixer and fit it with the 1/4-inch die. On medium speed, grind the pork mixture into the mixer bowl. Feed a crumpled paper towel through the grinder to force out any remaining bits of sausage. With the paddle attachment, mix the sausage on medium-low speed until homogeneous and tacky, about 2 minutes. Shape and cook as desired.

## Italian Sausage
### Ingredients
- 450 g (about 1 lb.) pork shoulder with at least 20% fat content, cut into rough 1-inch chunks
- 7 g (~1.5%) kosher salt
- 1 medium clove garlic, grated on microplane
- 1 T fennel seeds
- 1/8 t freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/2 t freshly ground black pepper
- 2 t red wine vinegar
- 1 T red pepper flakes

## Bratwurst
### Ingredients
- 450 g (about 1 lb.) pork shoulder with at least 20% fat content, cut into rough 1-inch chunks
- 7 g (~1.5%) kosher salt
- 2 medium cloves garlic, grated on microplane
- 3/4 t freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/4 t ground ginger
- 1/2 t freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 c sour cream or crème fraîche

## Modifications
Both were very good. I think the only change I want is to add more garlic and pepper to the bratwurst.
