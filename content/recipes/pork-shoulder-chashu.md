This is maybe the most revered recipe I've made.  I don't make it often because it requires planning (and I've almost completely stopped making recipes with meat), but it is well-loved.

I really just follow Sho's recipe here: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2019/04/sous-vide-pork-shoulder-chashu-recipe.html.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 ounce (14g) kosher salt[^1]
- 1/2 ounce (14g) granulated sugar[^1]
- 1 pork shoulder roast (about 2 pounds; 900g)
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) mirin

## Process

1. Dry brine pork shoulder roast with salt and sugar.  Seal in vacuum sealer and place in refrigerator for 24 hours.
1. Prepare sous vide water bath for 145 F[^2]
1. Remove shoulder from bag, discard liquid, and blot dry.  Tie roast into nice cylinder with kitchen twine (this makes the resulting portions nice and circular).  Return roast to bag with mirin and soy sauce and seal again.
1. Cook roast in water bath for 20 hours.
1. Remove from water bath and allow to chill if you have the time.
1. Employ some method to get a good crust.
   - Under a broiler, rotating ocassionally
   - Over a grill
   - Blowtorch?
   - You could probably even use a blazing hot cast iron pan
1. To serve, slice the log radially

[^1]: The amount of salt-sugar cure should be adjusted if you're using a pork roast that's slightly larger or slightly smaller than 2 pounds. Use 3% of the weight of the pork roast in salt-sugar cure mixture.
[^2]: If you'd like to cook the pork to a different temperature, the cooking time will have to be adjusted accordingly. As a general rule, if you're using a lower temperature, the pork must cook for a longer time; if you're using a higher temperature, the pork will cook for a shorter time.
