My starter isn't cutting it from my [ginger beer]({{< ref "ginger-beer" >}}) recipe, so I'm trying to just create a syrup for adding to seltzer. I'm actually going to carbonate my own seltzer water with my homebrew kegging setup, keeping things pretty cheap (if you ignore the cost of all the equipment for the kegging, but it wasn't being used anyway...)

## Ingredients
- 100 ml filtered water
- 120 g sugar
- 57 g ginger, grated on a microplane

## Process
1. Heat water to simmer
1. Add sugar and mix until dissolved
1. Add ginger and remove from heat
1. Let cool to room temperature
1. Strain through fine mesh strainer into sealable container, pressing out the juices
1. Store in fridge until [use](#to-use)

## To use
- Add ~1/4 of syrup to each 12 oz. of seltzer
