My starter isn't cutting it from my [ginger beer]({{< ref "ginger-beer" >}}) recipe, so I'm trying to just create a syrup for adding to seltzer. I'm actually going to carbonate my own seltzer water with my homebrew kegging setup, keeping things pretty cheap (if you ignore the cost of all the equipment for the kegging, but it wasn't being used anyway...)

## Ingredients
- 100 ml filtered water
- 120 g sugar
- 57 g ginger, grated on a microplane

## Process
1. Combine water, sugar, and grated ginger in stock pot, bring to a simmer then cut heat. Let cool to room temperature.
1. Strain through fine mesh strainer. Press out juices.
1. Pour in to sealable - preferably plastic - bottles.
1. Place in fridge, cool, and enjoy.

## To use
- Add ~1/4 of syrup to each 12 oz. of seltzer
