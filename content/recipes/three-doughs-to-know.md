Three pizza dough recipes from [Kenji @ Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-pizza-lab-three-doughs-to-know)

## **1. [Neapolitan-Style Pizza Dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-neapolitan-pizza-dough-recipe}**

### **Ingredients**

- 100% All-purpose or bread flour (preferably finely milled Italian-style flour like Caputo "00")
- 65% Water
- 2% Salt
- 1.5% Instant yeast


### **Instructions**

1. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl.
2. Mix until no dry flour remains. No-knead mixing is sufficient.
3. Cover the bowl and let the dough undergo a long cold ferment in the refrigerator for at least 3 days, up to 5 days.
4. Before baking, allow the dough to come to room temperature.
5. Shape and bake using high-temperature methods such as:
    - Skillet-broiler method
    - Stove-top skillet pizza
    - Kettle-pizza grill insert
    - Directly on grill grates
6. Bake at ultra-high temperatures (900°F if possible) for about 90 seconds until puffed and leopard-spotted.

### **Ingredients**

- 100% Bread flour (or all-purpose flour)

- 1.5% Salt
- 1.5% Instant yeast
- 5% Olive oil


### **Instructions**

4. Bring the dough to room temperature before shaping.
5. Roll out into a thin crust, slightly thicker than Neapolitan-style.
6. Bake at around 500°F for 12–15 minutes until golden brown with slight spotting.
