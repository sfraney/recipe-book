From the University of California "Olives: Safe Methods for Home Pickling": Kalamata-style Olives.  For some reason, the PDF is DRM (digital rights management) protected, so I had to transcribe...

## Supplies

- Mature, fully colored (dark red to purplish black) olives
- Pickling salt
- Red wine vinegar
- Olive oil
- Airtight, food-grade plastic or glass containers

## Preparation

1. Rinse olives
1. Make 2 lengthwise cuts on each olive, slicing about 1/8" into the flesh
1. Cover olives with fresh cool water in a food-grade container, keeping the olives submerged with a weight
1. Close container loosely and leave olives to soak
1. After 24 hours, drain olives and cover again with fresh cool water.  Repear water change daily for 8 to 10 days to reach desired level of de-bittering (can go up to 20 days, but be careful; over-soaking will lead to soft olives with washed-out taste)
1. Prepare finish brine:  add 1 lb. pickling salt to 1 gallon cool water, stir to dissolve.  Add 1 quart red wine vinegar.  This will be enough to treat 10 lbs. of fresh olives.
   1.  **Convert this to percentage concentration**
1. Drain olives, cover with finish brine, and pour 1/4" to 3/8" olive oil on top.  Close lid firmly an store at room temperature.
1. Allow olives to marinate in finish brine for about 1 month to develop desired flavor.
