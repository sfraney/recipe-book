## Ingredients
(~1/2 of original)

### Cheese Sauce
- 3 oz. grated romano cheese
- 3 oz. shredded fontina cheese
- 3 oz. crumbled gorgonzola cheese
- 3/8 C ricotta cheese
- 6 oz provolone/mozarella blend, shredded
- 3 C heavy cream

### Remainder
- 1 lb. dry penne noodles
- 1 lb. italian sausage (loose is fine, but recipe assumes cased)
- 2 T olive oil, divided
- 1 medium yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced
- 1/2 t red pepper flakes
- kosher salt, to taste
- red pepper flakes
- bunch of fresh chopped basil
- parmigiano reggiano

## Process

1. Prepare cheese sauce: Weigh all cheese into large mixing bowl. Add heavy cream. Working in small batches blend in a blender, food processor or using a stick mixer. Be careful not to over blend, you still want to see some chunks of cheese.
1. Cut italian sausages into quarters width-wise and ~2 inch sections length-wise. Remove casings (may be done first).
1. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a heavy duty skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook, stirring to break-up into smaller pieces, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a paper-towel lined plate and pour off any fat remaining in the pan.
1. Set the skillet back over medium-high heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion begins to brown, about 10 minutes.
1. Reduce heat to low, add the cooked sausage, red pepper flakes, and cheese sauce and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 2 minutes.
1. Meanwhile, cook the penne until just shy of al dente (about 1 minute less than the package directs). Reserve one cup of the pasta water (more than necessary, to be safe) and drain the pasta in a colander. Return the pasta to the pot over medium heat and stir in the cheese and sausage mixture until well combined. Add 1/2 cup pasta water, increase heat to high, and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until a creamy, emulsified sauce forms and coats the noodles. Remove from the heat and add salt and black pepper to taste. Serve immediately, sprinkling shredded parmigiano regianno and basil on each plate.
