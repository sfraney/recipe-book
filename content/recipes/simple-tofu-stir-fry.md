## Prep Notes

### Tofu
1. Pat very dry.
2. Optional: lightly salt and rest 10–15 minutes.
3. Pat dry again before cooking.

### Moisture Control
- Preserved cabbage must be rinsed and squeezed very dry.
- Bamboo shoots must be drained and patted dry.
- If ingredients are wet, they will steam instead of sear.

## Cooking (Carbon Steel Wok)

Heat wok over high until lightly smoking.

### 1. Sear the Tofu
- Add ~2 tbsp neutral oil.
- Lay tofu in a single layer.
- Do not move for 1–2 minutes.
- Flip and brown multiple sides.
- Remove and set aside.

Goal: drive off moisture and build crust.

---

### 2. Scramble the Egg
- Add a small splash of oil if needed.
- Pour in egg.
- Let set briefly, then break into soft curds.
- Remove while slightly underdone.

---

### 3. Aromatics + Preserved Cabbage
- Add 1 tbsp oil.
- Add garlic and preserved cabbage.
- Stir-fry 15–30 seconds until fragrant.

The cabbage should sizzle and lightly fry, not steam.

---

### 4. Hard Vegetables
- Add carrot and celery.
- Toss aggressively for 1–2 minutes.
- Add bamboo shoots.
- Cook until crisp-tender.

---

### 5. Combine
- Return tofu and egg.
- Toss briefly to distribute.

---

### 6. Sauce
- Pour sauce around the perimeter of the wok.
- Toss rapidly to glaze.
- Cook 20–30 seconds until lightly reduced and clinging.

## Adjustments

- Too flat → add a splash of vinegar.
- Too sharp → small pinch of sugar.
- Too salty → serve over plain rice rather than adjusting.

Serve immediately.
