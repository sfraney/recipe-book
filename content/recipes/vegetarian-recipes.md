## Entrees (in preference order)

The top 7 of this list will possibly become family staples. The rest didn’t gain widespread – if any – support and probably won’t be made again.

1. [Mejadra](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/mejadra-from-jerusalem.html "Mejadra")
   - Major ingredients: Lentils, Rice
   - Preparation notes: Frying onions may splatter => use splatter protection (e.g., wok w/ frywall)
1. Cauliflower General Tso’s – variant of [Kenji's The Best General Tso's Chicken](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/04/the-best-general-tsos-chicken-food-lab-chinese-recipe.html "The Best General Tso's Chicken")
   - This is so good! I want to put it up to #1, but need to let my excitement settle to get some perspective.
     - The sauce and fried cauliflower are awesome by themselves and made better together
     - Fried cauliflower has a great crunchiness and the little chunks of fried dredge that stick to them are so good
     - Sauce has a good sweetness without being cloying (like Kenji was going for) and it’s got some heat without being overwhelming
   - Replace chicken with 1 large head of cauliflower cut into bite sized pieces
   - Don’t put as much marinade in the dredge as the recipe says
     - Ended up with large chunks and had to add flour to get the right consistency (luckily there was a picture of what we were going for)
     - The amount of marinade (with 1/2 in the dredge) was a good amount => if using less in the dredge, could probably get away with making less marinade
       - OTOH, the amount of dredge was about right with adding ~1/4 C of flour so maybe it just worked out right with our modifications
   - 2 arbols is plenty (I would be fine with ~4 but more sensitive mouths would prefer no more than 2, and maybe even 1)
   - Lots of work and messy, but definitely worth it.
1. [Falafel](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/the-food-lab-vegan-experience-best-homemade-falafel-recipe.html "Falafel")
   - Major ingredients: Chickpeas, Cilantro/Parsley/Mint mixture
   - Preparation notes: Requires soaking chickpeas
   - Deep frying
1. [Ricotta Gnocchi](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/03/ricotta-gnocchi-homemade-food-lab-recipe.html "Ricotta Gnocchi")
1. [Anda Bhurji](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/anda-bhurji-spicy-indian-scrambled-eggs-recipe.html "Anda Bhurji") – Spicy Indian Scrambled Eggs
1. [Curried Lentils with Coconut Milk](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2008/11/dinner-tonight-curried-red-lentils-with-cocon.html "Curried Lentils with Coconut Milk") – need to thicken better (maybe use coconut cream?) and increase spices (turmeric to ~1T, double cumin & coriander)
1. [Chickpea, Potato, and Spinach Jalfrezi](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/chickpea-potato-and-spinach-jalfrezi-with-cilantro-chutney-recipe.html "Chickpea, Potato, and Spinach Jalfrezi") (“dry” curry)
1. [Black Bean Burgers](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/03/the-best-black-bean-burger-recipe.html "Black Bean Burgers")
1. [Shakshuka](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/09/shakshuka-north-african-shirred-eggs-tomato-pepper-recipe.html "Shakshuka") (2/3 liked this, the other was not a fan)
   - Major ingredients: Peppers (mild), Onion, Tomato
1. [Channa Masala](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/04/channa-masala-recipe.html "Channa Masala") (or my [previous post]({{< ref "chole" >}} "Chole"))
   - Preparation notes: Requires soaking chickpeas
1. Butter Sauce – Either [this](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/05/easy-butter-paneer-spinach-recipe.html "Easy Butter Paneer Spinach") or [this](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/potato-and-pea-curry-aloo-matar-indian-recipe.html "Potato and Pea Curry") – I imagine, with a good sauce base, you could add potatoes, chickpeas, paneer, tofu, etc. (and potentially end up making one or the other of the linked recipes)
1. [Chickpea, Cashew, and Coconut Curry](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/05/chickpea-coconut-and-cashew-curry-recipe.html "Chickpea, Cashew, and Coconut Curry") (the other 2 seemed to like it fine, though they didn’t eat the leftovers. I did not like it…)

### Untried

- [Menemen](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/09/menemen-turkish-style-scrambled-eggs-tomatoes-chilies-recipe.html "Menemen") – Turkish variant of Shakshuka
  - Major ingredients: Peppers (mild), Tomato, Egg

## Sides

1. [Hummus](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/basic-hummus-from-jerusalem-ottolenghi.html "Hummus") – I’ve made this a bunch of times, it’s awesome
1. [Potato Cakes (Rösti)](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/vegan-crispy-potato-onion-mushroom-rosti-roesti-recipe.html "Potato Cakes (Rösti)") (3/3 really liked this)
1. [Tortilla Española](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/07/tortilla-espanola-spanish-potato-omelette-recipe.html "Tortilla Española") (3/3 really liked this)
1. [French Fries]({{< ref "french-fries" >}} "French Fries") (3/3)
1. [Roasted Cabbage](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/12/easy-roasted-cabbage.html "Roasted Cabbage") (3/3 thought it was better than they expected – i.e., it was pretty decent, but it didn’t all get eaten…)
1. [Onion Rings](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/09/foolproof-onion-rings-food-lab-recipe.html "Onion Rings")
   - Excellent crunch
   - Needs salt. Either incorporate into batter or sprinkle better over cooling rings. I used table salt, maybe just switching to kosher would have helped.
   - Need to make sure and fry at an appropriate temperature. Fried a little too cool and they ended up pretty greasy (at least the theory is that they would be less greasy at a higher temperature).
   - A lot of work that creates a lot of mess. Probably not worth the effort, TBH.

### Untried

- [Creamed Spinach](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/10/food-lab-creamed-spinach-recipe.html "Creamed Spinach")

## Soups (in preference order)

The top 6 have pretty widespread support in the house. The Soondubu Jjigae only really appeals to one or two of us, but that’s enough for it to be acceptable every once in a while. The Black Bean Soup just didn’t turn out great.

1. [Vegan Ramen](https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/02/how-to-make-the-ultimate-vegan-ramen-rich-and-creamy-vegan-experience.html "Vegan Ramen") – this stuff is really good, but it requires a time investment and a long grocery list, mostly to make the variety of add-ons necessary to make it a proper bowl of ramen. Sun ramen noodles are highly recommended over dried substitutes.
1. [Potato-Leek Soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/best-potato-leek-soup-recipe.html "Potato-Leek Soup") – very good, but a little thinner than we’d like. Try 1.5 lb. potato with the 1 qt. stock. 1.25 lb. potato with just over 1 qt. stock was still too thin. Honestly, as written it’s appropriate, but I think for our taste, thicker is better.
1. French Onion Soup – from the Food Lab
1. [Lentil soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/easy-lentil-soup-parsley-garlic-lemon-gremolata-recipe.html "Lentil soup") - oh yeah, this is very good.  Sort of a staple around the house now.  Using homegrown parsely takes it up a notch.
1. [Gazpacho](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/08/andalusian-gazpacho-recipe.html "Gazpacho") – very good, even though we didn’t have really ripe tomatoes (they were late January, not-so-ripe tomatoes) and the 30 minutes in the freezer wasn’t enough to actually freeze the vegetables
1. [Broccoli Cheese Soup]({{< ref "broccoli-cheese-soup" >}} "Broccoli Cheese Soup") – minor tweak on Kenji’s that’s a small improvement on the nutrition of our house recipe with a nice little incorporation of cheddar flavor. Pairs very well with [Mama Star garlic chili oil](https://mamastarchilioil.com/product/combo-chili-oil/ "Mama Star combo chili oil").
1. [Tofu Tortilla Soup]({{< ref "tortilla-soup" >}} "Tofu Tortilla Soup")
1. [Spicy Ginger and Carrot Soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/01/spicy-carrot-and-ginger-soup-with-harissa.html "Spicy Ginger and Carrot Soup")
1. [Soondubu Jjigae](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/soondubu-jjigae-korean-soft-tofu-stew-recipe.html "Soondubu Jjigae") – Good for when the one person in the house that doesn't like it, is away - See below for some sides I want to include next time I make this (from https://www.koreanbapsang.com/15-korean-vegetable-side-dishes/)
   1. [Gamja Jorim](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/gamja-jorim-braised-potatoes/ "Gamja Jorim") (Korean Braised Potatoes)
   1. [Sigeumchi Namul](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/sigeumchi-namul-korean-spinach-side/ "Sigeumchi Namul") (Blanched Seasoned Spinach) – this is a real winner. Made with ~5 oz. and we really wished we had more (so I bought a good pound of spinach for a remake).
      - Excellent candidate for cryoblanching. Did the original ~5 oz. with traditional blanch and the other 3 oz. of the package cryoblanched. No discernable difference.
   1. [Dubu Jorim](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/dubu-jorim-korean-braised-tofu/ "Dubu Jorim") (Braised Tofu)
   1. [Gyeranjjim](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/gyeranjjim-korean-steamed-eggs/ "Gyeranjjim") (Korean Steamed Eggs)
   1. [Sesame Broccoli](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/sesame-broccoli/ "Sesame Broccoli")
   1. [Korean Pickled Garlic](https://www.koreanbapsang.com/maneul-jangajji-korean-pickled-garlic/ "Korean Pickled Garlic") (Maneul Jangajji)
1. [Black Bean Soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/30-minute-black-bean-soup-recipe.html "Black Bean Soup") – this seems to have a little spice to it (jalapeno or serrano plus chipotle chili packed in adobo sauce)

### Untried

- [Lettuce Soup](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/07/lettuce-soup-hot-chilled-recipe.html "Lettuce Soup")
- [Spanish Chickpea and Spinach Stew With Ginger](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/01/vegan-garbanzos-con-espinacas-jengibre-spinach-chickpea-stew-ginger-spanish.html "Spanish Chickpea and Spinach Stew With Ginger")
