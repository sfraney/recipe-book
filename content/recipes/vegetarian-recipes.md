## Entrees (in preference order)

The top 7 of this list will possibly become family staples. The rest didn’t gain widespread – if any – support and probably won’t be made again.

1. Mejadra
   - Major ingredients: Lentils, Rice
   - Preparation notes: Frying onions may splatter => use splatter protection (e.g., wok w/ frywall)
1. Cauliflower General Tso’s – variant of https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/04/the-best-general-tsos-chicken-food-lab-chinese-recipe.html
   - This is so good! I want to put it up to #1, but need to let my excitement settle to get some perspective.
     - The sauce and fried cauliflower are awesome by themselves and made better together
     - Fried cauliflower has a great crunchiness and the little chunks of fried dredge that stick to them are so good
     - Sauce has a good sweetness without being cloying (like Kenji was going for) and it’s got some heat without being overwhelming
   - Replace chicken with 1 large head of cauliflower cut into bite sized pieces
   - Don’t put as much marinade in the dredge as the recipe says
     - Ended up with large chunks and had to add flour to get the right consistency (luckily there was a picture of what we were going for)
     - The amount of marinade (with 1/2 in the dredge) was a good amount => if using less in the dredge, could probably get away with making less marinade
       - OTOH, the amount of dredge was about right with adding ~1/4 C of flour so maybe it just worked out right with our modifications
   - 2 arbols is plenty (I would be fine with ~4 but more sensitive mouths would prefer no more than 2, and maybe even 1)
   - Lots of work and messy, but definitely worth it.
1. Falafel
   - Major ingredients: Chickpeas, Cilantro/Parsley/Mint mixture
   - Preparation notes: Requires soaking chickpeas
   - Deep frying
1. Ricotta Gnocchi
1. Anda Bhurji – Spicy Indian Scrambled Eggs
1. Curried Lentils with Coconut Milk – need to thicken better (maybe use coconut cream?) and increase spices (turmeric to ~1T, double cumin & coriander)
1. Chickpea, Potato, and Spinach Jalfrezi (“dry” curry)
1. Black Bean Burgers
1. Shakshuka (2/3 liked this, the other was not a fan)
   - Major ingredients: Peppers (mild), Onion, Tomato
1. Channa Masala (or my previous post)
   - Preparation notes: Requires soaking chickpeas
1. Butter Sauce – Either this or this – I imagine, with a good sauce base, you could add potatoes, chickpeas, paneer, tofu, etc. (and potentially end up making one or the other of the linked recipes)
1. Chickpea, Cashew, and Coconut Curry (the other 2 seemed to like it fine, though they didn’t eat the leftovers. I did not like it…)

### Untried

- Menemen – Turkish variant of Shakshuka
  - Major ingredients: Peppers (mild), Tomato, Egg

## Sides

1. Hummus – I’ve made this a bunch of times, it’s awesome
1. Potato Cakes (Rösti) (3/3 really liked this)
1. Tortilla Española – I didn’t actually make this, but I think this recipe is pretty close
1. French Fries (3/3)
1. Roasted Cabbage (3/3 thought it was better than they expected – i.e., it was pretty decent, but it didn’t all get eaten…)
1. Onion Rings
   - Excellent crunch
   - Needs salt. Either incorporate into batter or sprinkle better over cooling rings. I used table salt, maybe just switching to kosher would have helped.
   - Need to make sure and fry at an appropriate temperature. Fried a little too cool and they ended up pretty greasy (at least the theory is that they would be less greasy at a higher temperature).
   - A lot of work that creates a lot of mess. Probably not worth the effort, TBH.

### Untried

- Creamed Spinach

## Soups (in preference order)

The top 6 have pretty widespread support in the house. The Soondubu Jjigae only really appeals to one or two of us, but that’s enough for it to be acceptable every once in a while. The Black Bean Soup just didn’t turn out great.

1. Vegan Ramen – this stuff is really good, but it requires a time investment and a long grocery list, mostly to make the variety of add-ons necessary to make it a proper bowl of ramen. Sun ramen noodles are highly recommended over dried substitutes.
1. Potato-Leek Soup – very good, but a little thinner than we’d like. Try 1.5 lb. potato with the 1 qt. stock. 1.25 lb. potato with just over 1 qt. stock was still too thin. Honestly, as written it’s appropriate, but I think for our taste, thicker is better.
1. French Onion Soup – from the Food Lab
1. Lentil soup
1. Gazpacho – very good, even though we didn’t have really ripe tomatoes (they were late January, not-so-ripe tomatoes) and the 30 minutes in the freezer wasn’t enough to actually freeze the vegetables
1. Broccoli Cheese Soup – minor tweak on Kenji’s that’s a small improvement on the nutrition of our house recipe with a nice little incorporation of cheddar flavor. Pairs very well with Mama Star garlic chili oil.
1. Tofu Tortilla Soup – modified version of Kenji’s Real Deal Tortilla Soup
   - Replaced chicken stock with vegetable scrap stock
   - Replaced chicken with tofu, fried to crispy crust
   - Replaced fresh corn & corn “milk” with canned corn and liquid
   - Didn’t have the time to add beans
1. Spicy Ginger and Carrot Soup
1. Soondubu Jjigae – See below for some sides I want to include next time I make this (from https://www.koreanbapsang.com/15-korean-vegetable-side-dishes/)
   1. Gamja Jorim (Korean Braised Potatoes)
   1. Sigeumchi Namul (Blanched Seasoned Spinach) – this is a real winner. Made with ~5 oz. and we really wished we had more (so I bought a good pound of spinach for a remake).
      - Excellent candidate for cryoblanching. Did the original ~5 oz. with traditional blanch and the other 3 oz. of the package cryoblanched. No discernable difference.
   1. Dubu Jorim (Braised Tofu)
   1. Gyeranjjim (Korean Steamed Eggs)
   1. Sesame Broccoli
   1. Korean Pickled Garlic (Maneul Jangajji)
1. Black Bean Soup – this seems to have a little spice to it (jalapeno or serrano plus chipotle chili packed in adobo sauce)

### Untried

- Lettuce Soup
- Spanish Chickpea and Spinach Stew With Ginger
