I wanted to use a pound of pork belly thawed in the fridge, but was afraid it was too fatty for [braised pork belly]({{< relref "braised-pork-belly.md" >}}) so I found this recipe - also from [The Woks of Life](https://thewoksoflife.com/twice-cooked-pork/) - to hopefully render more of the fat first.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound pork belly (450g, you HAVE to use pork belly, or it's not twice cooked pork)
- 2 slices ginger
- 2 tablespoons oil (divided)
- 1 1/2 tablespoons broad bean paste (doubanjiang), spicy or not
- 2 cloves garlic (sliced)
- Optional: 2 long hot green peppers (seeds removed and cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces)
- 1 medium leek (split lengthwise, washed thoroughly, and cut in 2-inch pieces)
- 1 tablespoon shaoxing wine
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 large carrot, cut into 1-inch matchsticks
- ~~1/4 teaspoon sugar~~

## Process

1. In a medium pot, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Add the whole piece of pork belly and the ginger, and bring the pot to a boil again. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, until the pork is tender and cooked through. Remove the pork from the pot and run it under cold running water for about a minute. Set aside.
1. While the pork is cooling, prepare all the other ingredients. Once you are ready to cook (don't do this in advance, or the pork will dry out), thinly slice the pork belly (slices should be about 1/8 inch thick).
1. Heat your wok over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and sear the pork, until you get a light caramelization, about 90 seconds. Turn the heat to medium-low and scoop out the pork. Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok.
1. Add the broad bean paste to the wok and let it fry in the oil for about 30 seconds to bring out the flavor and color. The color should be red; pay attention to the heat to avoid burning.
1. Now add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Turn the heat to high and add the pork, carrots, and leeks. Stir-fry for a minute. Add the shaoxing wine and soy sauce. Stir everything together. Once the leeks and are wilted and the peppers are cooked (while still having a little crunch), transfer to a serving dish.
1. Optional: Add the peppers to the hot pan with a little leftover oil and fry until likely blistered in parts

## Impressions

This was very good. I adapted by
- Adding some carrot sticks and omitting the sugar
- Cooking the spicy peppers separate so folks that didn't want spice didn't have to eat them
- Using non-spicy broad bean paste (doubanjiang)
