Modified from [Kenji's 'Best Buffalo Wings Recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/ultimate-extra-crispy-double-fried-confit-buffalo-wings "Kenji's 'Best Buffalo Wings Recipe").

## Ingredients

- enough tallow to get about 1" depth in your frying pan
- 2 pounds chicken wings, cut into drumettes and flats
- 4 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter
- TBD: Sauces
  - ~~1/2 cup base hot sauce (Frank's, etc.)~~
  - ~~To taste, hot sauce for flavor or heat~~
- Ranch dressing
- Celery sticks

## Process

1. Place oil and chicken wings in a large cast iron skillet. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers 225 to 250째F on an instant-read thermometer (chicken should be gently bubbling). Continue to cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 225 to 250째F until chicken is cooked through and skin is tender but not crisp or browned, about 20 minutes total. Transfer chicken with a wire mesh spider to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow chicken to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or cover and rest in the fridge for up to three nights.

1. Need to play this by ear.  Want to have mostly sauce, even when it's a super hot sauce, but don't want to waste sauce and would like to get a nice coating via sauce mixed with butter.  May just put a dab or two of sauce in a bowl with equal-ish amount of butter and melt and mix together before tossing.
   - ~~When ready to serve, combine butter and hot sauces[^1] in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until butter is completely melted. Transfer to a large bowl. Heat oil to 400째F. Carefully add one third of chicken and cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 375 to 400째F until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to bowl with sauce, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery. Repeat with remaining batches, serving one batch at a time.~~
