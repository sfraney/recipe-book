Modified from [Kenji's 'Best Buffalo Wings Recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/ultimate-extra-crispy-double-fried-confit-buffalo-wings "Kenji's 'Best Buffalo Wings Recipe").

## Ingredients

- Enough tallow to get about 1" depth in your frying pan
- 3 pounds chicken wings, cut into drumettes and flats
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank's, sriracha, or something more daring)
- Ranch or [Blue Cheese]({{< ref "blue-cheese-dressing" >}}) dressing
- Celery sticks

## Process

1. Spread wings out on a rack-lined rimmed baking sheet.  Pat dry with a paper towel and salt.  Don't overdo the salt, 'cause these don't have a lot of meat on them.  Place in refrigerator to allow salt to penetrate, at least 1 hour up to overnight[^1].

1. Place oil and chicken wings in a large cast iron skillet. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers 225 to 250°F on an instant-read thermometer (chicken should be gently bubbling). Continue to cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 225 to 250°F until chicken is cooked through and skin is tender but not crisp or browned, about 20 minutes total. Transfer chicken with a wire mesh spider to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow chicken to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or cover and rest in the fridge for up to three nights.

1. When ready to serve, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.

1. Heat oil to 400°F. Carefully add one third of chicken and cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 375 to 400°F until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to bowl with sauce, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery.

1. Combine 1 part butter with 1 part hot sauce in a bowl[^2].  Add wings to bowl, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery. Repeat with remaining batches, serving one batch at a time.

1. In order to sauce one batch of wings while others are frying, preheat an oven to 200°F and place sauced wings in oven on rack-lined rimmed baking sheet until all wings are done.  This keeps the wings warm and seems to help set the sauce to prevent them from being too saucy.

[^2]: I found 1 teaspoon hot sauce to 1 teaspoon butter to be a good coating for 4 - 6 wings.

## Impressions

I agree, these _are_ the best chicken wings.  They are juicy and tender inside with a thin crackling skin on the outside that holds sauce well.

### Next Time

I under-sauced this initial batch so they weren't very hot (even the ones coated in super-hot hot sauces, like [Hellfire Kranked](https://heatonist.com/products/hellfire-kranked-1?variant=39373094060130 "Heatonist Hellfire Kranked Store Page"), but they still tasted awesome.  All the wings got a coating of [Umami Everyday Sauce](https://www.seedranchflavor.com/products/umami-everyday-sauce "Seed Ranch Umami Everyday Sauce Page") (because I didn't clean out the bowl after treating the first wings with them and sauce remained) which couldn't have hurt, that sauce creates a great base flavor.
