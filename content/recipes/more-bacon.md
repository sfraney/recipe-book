Today (2/23/2020), I started 2 new batches of bacon, following AmazingRibs.com’s recipes: the Simple one that we liked so much the first time, and the “Asian” version that sounded pretty good. I didn’t deviate from the process I used last time, except I used a gallon Ziploc storage bag for the Simple version since I didn’t have an appropriately-sized Food Saver bag (I used the last of our roll recently).

The Simple recipe batch consists of 2.5 lbs. of pork belly with appropriately-scaled ingredients and the Asian version consists of a 2 lb. belly.

Now I need to figure out what to do with the remaining ~2 lbs. of belly. A good problem to have.

## Impressions

These are both excellent. My daughter and I like the traditional/simple bacon a little better and the wife likes the asian style a little better. We all agree that both are head and shoulders above store-bought, though.
