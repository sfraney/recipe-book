I made some excellent pork chops last night and we had quite a bit of leftover (it started out as 3.67 lbs.). Trying to use again, not lose the excellence, but not eat the same thing.

## Ingredients

- 2 leftover pork chops, thinly sliced across the grain  
- 2–3 cups cooked black rice + quinoa blend (cold is ideal)  
- 6–8 oz mushrooms, sliced  
- 1 medium carrot, small dice  
- 1 celery stalk, small dice  
- 1/2 medium onion, small dice  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 2–3 tbsp neutral oil (divided)  

### Sauce
- 1 1/2–2 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1–2 tsp rice vinegar (or a small splash of any mild vinegar)  
- Optional: 1 tsp butter for richness  
- Optional: a few drops sesame oil  

### Optional Add-In
- 1–2 tbsp sauerkraut or tianjin preserved cabbage, finely chopped

## Process

### 1. Prep
Slice pork thin across the grain.  
Break up any clumps in the cold rice so it’s loose and ready to fry.

### 2. Cook the vegetables
Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high to high heat.  
Add 1–2 tbsp oil.

Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook 3–4 minutes until just tender.  
Add mushrooms and cook until they release moisture and begin to brown, about 4–6 minutes.

Add garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant.

Push everything to one side of the pan.

### 3. Warm the pork
Add a small splash of oil to the empty side.  
Add sliced pork and cook just until heated through, about 1–2 minutes. Avoid overcooking.

Combine everything in the pan.

### 4. Fry the rice
Add remaining oil if needed, then add the rice blend.  
Spread it out and let it sit 30–60 seconds to lightly toast before stirring.

Stir-fry 3–4 minutes until heated through and slightly crisp in spots.

### 5. Season
Add soy sauce and vinegar. Toss well.  
If using, stir in butter until melted.  
Finish with a few drops of sesame oil if desired.

If adding sauerkraut, stir it in at the very end so it stays bright.

## Notes

- Cold, day-old rice fries better than freshly cooked rice.  
- Keep the heat high; moisture is the enemy of good texture.  
- If the pan feels crowded, cook vegetables and pork in batches.  
- Taste before adding salt — soy sauce may be enough.

Serve immediately.
