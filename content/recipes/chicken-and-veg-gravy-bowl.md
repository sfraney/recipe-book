From ChatGPT prompted with, "Help me come up with a dinner inspired by chicken pot pie filling. We will eat it with black rice since folks are diabetic."

## Ingredients

- 2 cups sous vide chicken thighs and/or legs, shredded or chopped
- 1 cup firm tofu, cubed (optional)
- 1 small onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ginger, minced
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 1 heaping cup broccoli florets
- 1 tablespoon Tianjin preserved cabbage, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- ½ teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns (or to taste)
- 1 cup broth or water
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water
- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
- Cooked black rice, for serving

## Instructions

1. **Prep your ingredients**: Slice vegetables, shred the chicken, cube the tofu, and mix your sauce and slurry.

2. **Stir-fry aromatics**: Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.

3. **Cook vegetables**: Add carrots and celery. Stir-fry for 2–3 minutes. Then add broccoli and cook another 2 minutes, until crisp-tender.

4. **Add proteins**: Stir in chicken (and tofu, if using). Cook for 1–2 minutes to heat through.

5. **Build the sauce**: Add Shaoxing wine to deglaze, then stir in soy sauce, oyster sauce, and preserved cabbage. Add broth or water and bring to a simmer.

6. **Season and thicken**: Add Sichuan pepper and vinegar. Stir in the cornstarch slurry and simmer 1–2 minutes until sauce thickens.

7. **Serve**: Spoon the mixture over warm black rice and serve immediately.

## Notes

- You can omit tofu if using more chicken, or swap tofu in entirely for a vegetarian version.
- Adjust heat with chili oil or extra Sichuan pepper if desired.
- Tianjin preserved cabbage is salty and umami-rich—adjust soy accordingly.
