From [Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a47565/cauliflower-pizza-crust-recipe/), adapted for gluten-free pizza lovers. The key to success is thoroughly draining the cauliflower to ensure a crispy, not soggy crust.

## Ingredients

- 1 large head cauliflower, roughly chopped
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella
- 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
- Kosher salt

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven**: Set to 425Â°F.

2. **Cook cauliflower**: In a large skillet, bring about 1/4" water to a boil. Season with salt. Add cauliflower in one even layer and cook until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes.
   - **Alternative**: [Cryo-blanch](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-cryo-blanch-vegetables-green-beans) by freezing cauliflower solid, then allowing to thaw in the refrigerator

3. **Drain thoroughly**: Transfer to a clean dish towel (or paper towels) and squeeze to drain water. This step is crucial for a crispy crust.

4. **Rice the cauliflower**: Add drained cauliflower to food processor and pulse until grated. Drain excess water in paper towels again.

5. **Make the dough**: Transfer drained cauliflower to a large bowl and add egg, mozzarella and Parmesan, then season with salt. Mix until combined.

6. **Form and bake crust**: Transfer dough to a baking sheet lined with cooking spray and pat into a crust. Bake until golden and dried out, 20 minutes.

7. **Add toppings**: Add desired toppings and bake until cheese is melted and crust is crisp, 10 minutes more.

## Notes

- **Drain all the water**: Take your time squeezing all the water out of the cauliflower. A dry crust means a crispy one.
- **Storage**: Best eaten fresh, but leftovers can be refrigerated for 2-3 days and reheated in the oven.
