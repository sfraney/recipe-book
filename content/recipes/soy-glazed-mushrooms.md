## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) peanut, rice bran, or other neutral oil
- 12 ounces (340 g) shiitake, button, or cremini mushrooms, trimmed (remove and discard stems from shiitake entirely), caps cut into quarters (see Note)
- 2 teaspoons (5 g) minced garlic (about 2 medium cloves)
- 2 teaspoons (5 g) minced fresh ginger (about Â½-inch segment)
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) light soy sauce or shoyu
- 2 teaspoons (8 g) sugar
- 1 teaspoon (5 ml) roasted sesame oil
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced on a bias
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Process

1. Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add the oil and swirl to coat. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry until the mushrooms are deeply browned and crisp in spots, but still juicy and tender, about 5 minutes, reducing the heat if the mushrooms threaten to burn.
1. Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds.
1. Splash the soy sauce around the edges of the wok and toss to combine. Add the sugar, sesame oil, scallions, and sesame seeds and toss until the mushrooms are thoroughly coated in the mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately or let them cool, transfer to a sealed container, and store them in the refrigerator for up to a week. Add them to salads, soups, or as a last-minute addition to other stir-fries.
