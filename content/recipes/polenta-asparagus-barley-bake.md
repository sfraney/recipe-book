## Overview

Firm polenta forms the base, topped with a savory barley–asparagus filling and finished with paneer. The barley is limited to 1 cup dry for the entire dish. Asparagus carries the vegetable bulk; paneer provides protein with moderate potassium impact.

## Ingredients

### Polenta Base
- 1 cup dry polenta (coarse cornmeal)
- 3 1/2–4 cups water
- 1/2 tsp salt

### Barley Filling
- 1 cup Italian barley (dry; do not exceed)
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 small onion, diced
- 2 ribs celery, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 bunch asparagus, cut into 1–1.5 inch pieces
- 1–2 tsp fermented black beans, rinsed and minced (optional but recommended)
- 1/4 cup finely chopped Tianjin preserved cabbage or zha cai (optional, adjust for salt)
- 6–8 oz paneer, diced small
- 1/2–1 cup water or light vegetable stock, as needed

## Instructions

### 1. Cook the Barley
1. Rinse barley.
2. Simmer in lightly salted water (about 3 cups) until just tender but still slightly firm, 25–35 minutes.
3. Drain and set aside.

Barley should be fully hydrated but not mushy; it will finish cooking in the oven.

### 2. Prepare the Polenta Base
1. Bring 3 1/2 cups water and salt to a boil.
2. Whisk in polenta slowly.
3. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently, until thick and pulling from the sides, 15–20 minutes.
4. Spread into a lightly oiled 9x9-inch baking dish in an even layer about 1/2–3/4 inch thick.
5. Let set while preparing filling.

Polenta should be firm enough to slice once baked.

### 3. Make the Filling
1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Heat oil in a skillet over medium.
3. Sauté onion and celery until softened, 5–7 minutes.
4. Add garlic and fermented black beans; cook 30 seconds.
5. Add asparagus and cook 3–4 minutes until just bright and slightly tender.
6. Stir in cooked barley, preserved cabbage (if using), and a splash of water or stock to lightly bind.
7. Fold in paneer and cook 1–2 minutes to warm through.
8. Adjust salt carefully; preserved ingredients are salty.

Mixture should be moist but not wet.

### 4. Assemble & Bake
1. Spread barley–asparagus filling evenly over set polenta.
2. Press lightly to level.
3. Bake 20–25 minutes until heated through and top is lightly golden at edges.

Optional: Broil 2–3 minutes for additional browning.

## Rest & Serve

Let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Cut into squares and serve warm.

## Notes

- To reduce potassium further, keep paneer at the lower end of the range and avoid increasing barley.
- For a firmer, more sliceable casserole, cool 20–30 minutes before serving.
- Leftovers reheat well in a skillet to crisp the polenta base.
