One of my favorite recipes from my initial [exploration of vegetarian cooking]({{< ref "vegetarian-recipes" >}}) was mejadra. We don't often have basmati rice around, though, because we have some folks watching their carb intake (though basmati is better than other white rices). This recipe is inspired by the traditional mejadra from [Jerusalem: A Cookbook](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/mejadra-from-jerusalem.html) by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, but adapted to be more diabetic-friendly by using red rice and quinoa instead of white basmati rice.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup red rice, rinsed
- ½ cup quinoa, rinsed
- 1 ½ cups brown or green lentils, rinsed
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp ground allspice
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1–1 ½ cups French's fried onions
- Optional: plain Greek yogurt for serving

## Process

1. **Cook lentils:** Place lentils in a saucepan, cover with plenty of water, bring to a boil, then simmer ~20 minutes until al dente. Drain.

2. **Cook red rice & quinoa:** In another pot, combine red rice with 2 cups water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer 25–30 minutes. Add quinoa and another 1 cup water, simmer covered 15 minutes more, until both are tender. Let stand 10 minutes, covered.

3. **Bloom spices:** Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium. Add cumin and coriander seeds, fry about 1 minute. Add turmeric, allspice, cinnamon, and black pepper; stir until fragrant.

4. **Combine:** Add cooked lentils, red rice, and quinoa to the spiced oil. Toss well and season with salt.

5. **Finish:** Transfer to a serving bowl and top generously with French's fried onions.

6. **Serve:** Optionally add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt on the side.

## Notes

- Red rice and quinoa provide complex carbohydrates that are digested more slowly than white rice, helping to maintain stable blood sugar levels
- Lentils are an excellent source of protein and fiber, further stabilizing blood glucose
- The combination of whole grains and legumes creates a complete protein
- French's fried onions add texture and flavor without significantly impacting the glycemic load
- This dish can be made ahead and reheated, making it perfect for meal prep
