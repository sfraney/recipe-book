Pork shoulder butt steaks (1-1.5 inches thick) need proper cooking to break down connective tissue. Pressure cooking achieves this much faster than traditional braising while maintaining tenderness. The flavors are inspired by my [pork shoulder chashu]({{< ref "pork-shoulder-chashu" >}}) recipe and use some leftover lemongrass from my Thanksgiving [lechon]({{<ref "lechon-porchetta">}}).

## Ingredients

- 1 lbs pork shoulder butt steaks (1-1.5 inches thick)
- 2 tablespoons neutral oil (for searing)
- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 1/3 cup mirin
- 1/4 cup shaoxing wine (or dry sherry) (optional)
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 (2-inch) knob ginger, sliced into coins
- 4-6 cloves garlic, smashed
- 3-4 scallions, cut into 2-inch pieces (white and light green parts)
- 2-3 stalks lemongrass, trimmed to bottom 4-6 inches, tough outer layers removed, bruised with flat of knife
- 1 cup chicken broth or water
- Optional: 1-2 star anise pods, 1 cinnamon stick

## Process

1. Pat steaks dry and season with salt and pepper.
1. Set Instant Pot to "Sauté" on high. Add oil and sear steaks until browned on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.
1. Add ginger, garlic, scallions, and lemongrass to the pot. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
1. Add soy sauce, mirin, shaoxing wine, brown sugar, and broth. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom.
1. Return steaks to the pot, nestling them in the liquid. Add star anise and cinnamon if using.
1. Close lid, set to "Pressure Cook" on high for 35 minutes. Allow natural release for 10 minutes, then quick release remaining pressure.
1. Remove steaks and tent with foil. Discard lemongrass stalks. Strain cooking liquid and return to pot. Set to "Sauté" and reduce until sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 5-10 minutes.
1. Optional: For extra texture, sear the steaks in a hot skillet for 1-2 minutes per side before serving.
1. Serve steaks with reduced sauce spooned over.

## Notes

- For thinner steaks (under 1 inch), reduce pressure time to 25-30 minutes.
- For thicker steaks (over 1.5 inches), increase to 40-45 minutes.
- The steaks should be fork-tender when done. If not, return to pressure for an additional 5-10 minutes.
