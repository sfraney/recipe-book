## Ingredients

- 2 ounces (60 g) mixed dried chiles, such as árbol, Japones, pasilla, California, negro, or ancho (see Notes)
- 3 tablespoons (15 g) Sichuan peppercorns
- 2 cups (500 ml) oil, preferably caiziyou (roasted rapeseed oil; see Notes)
- 4 medium garlic cloves (10 to 15 g), lightly smashed with the side of a knife
- One ½-inch knob fresh ginger (about 30 g), smashed with the side of a knife
- 1 medium shallot (about 1½ ounces/45 g), roughly chopped
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 3 dried bay leaves
- 2 whole star anise pods
- 1 tablespoon (8 g) whole fennel seeds
- One 2-inch piece orange zest removed from a fresh orange with a vegetable peeler

### To Finish
- ¾ cup (75 g) ground Sichuan er jing tiao or Korean chile flakes (see Notes)
- 2 tablespoons (16 g) white sesame seeds (optional)
- ½ teaspoon (2 g) MSG (optional)
- 1 teaspoon (4 g) kosher salt

## Process

1. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut all of the whole chiles into ½-inch pieces and discard the seeds. Toast the cut chiles and 1 tablespoon (5 g) of the Sichuan peppercorns in a dry wok or saucepan over medium heat, stirring and shaking constantly, until fragrant and lightly darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Transfer the toasted chiles to the bowl of a food processor or mortar and pestle and pulse or pound until the chiles break into ⅛- to ¼-inch pieces that resemble store-bought red-pepper flakes or flaky sea salt. (Be careful not to overprocess.) Set aside.

1. Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons (10 g) Sichuan peppercorns, the oil, garlic, ginger, shallot, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, star anise, fennel seeds, and orange zest in your wok. Heat over medium-low heat until gently bubbling, then reduce the heat until the bubbling mostly subsides (the oil should register 200° to 225°F (95° to 105°C) on an instant-read thermometer). Cook until the garlic and shallots are pale golden brown and the oil is intensely aromatic, about 30 minutes.

1. Strain the oil through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the spices and aromatics (you can save the lightly browned garlic and shallots to chop and add to eggs or noodle dishes, or just season with salt and eat them on their own; they are delicious).

1. Return the oil to the wok and add the pounded chile/Sichuan peppercorn mixture as well as the ground chile flakes. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the chile flakes begin to bubble gently, then reduce the heat until the bubbling mostly subsides (the oil should register 200° to 225°F (95° to 105°C) on an instant-read thermometer). Cook stirring occasionally, until the oil is deep red and has a slightly nutty aroma, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the sesame seeds, MSG, and salt. Allow the oil to cool completely, then transfer to sealable containers. For best flavor, let the oil rest overnight in the refrigerator before using. The oil should last for several months or longer in sealed containers in the refrigerator.
