One day I heard about a vegan ramen recipe on Serious Eats. I think it was mentioned in a Reddit post as a ridiculous amount of work, but it ended up delicious. I figured, since I’m obviously not vegan based on my other posts, why not just make non-vegan ramen. Maybe it would be easier.

Of course Kenji had a recipe for that, too: Kenji’s Tonkotsu Ramen Broth recipe

One day, I made it to the local butcher and was able to pick up some pig trotters and found a whole chicken at the grocery store (I also happened to pick up a big old brisket and some prague powder for bacon). This gave me my first experience breaking down a chicken. It was easier and less gross than I expected it to be. I won’t think twice about doing it again, though I think I’ll break down the wings a little more into buffalo wing pieces. The whole wing kinda grossed me out when we ended up eating it. It was too much skin.

## Impressions

Didn't turn out being so great.  Later, when I actually made the vegan recipe I read about to start this journey, it was pretty awesome and, I think, easier.
