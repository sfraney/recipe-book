Based, very loosely at this point, on Kenji's Best Creamy Chicken Enchiladas Recipe: https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chicken-enchiladas-recipe

## Ingredients

- Chili Sauce (see "Red Chili Sauce" post)
- 1 cup loosely packed picked fresh cilantro leaves and fine stems, plus chopped cilantro for garnish
- 2 lbs. protein: refried beans, cooked beans, tofu, shredded chicken, etc.
- ~6 tortillas (corn or flour)
- 8 ounces shredded pepper Jack cheese, divided
- 1 cup Mexican-style crema, recipe below if you don't have it ready-made

## Process

### Enchiladas

1. Add 1 cup of sauce, half of cheese, and half of Mexican crema to protein and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
1. Spread 1/3 of the sauce in the bottom of a 13- by 9-inch casserole dish. Dip each tortilla in the remaining sauce and stack on a cutting board. Working one tortilla at at time, place 2 tablespoons of chicken filling in a line down the center and roll up tightly. Place in the casserole dish seam side-down. Continue until all the tortillas and filling are used (the casserole will be tightly packed).
1. Spread remaining sauce on top of enchiladas and lay the remaining cheese down in a line through the middle of each row of enchiladas. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until cheese is lightly browned and bubbly, about 10 minutes longer.
1. Remove enchiladas from oven, drizzle with remaining crema, sprinkle with chopped cilantro, and serve immediately.

### Crema

1. Mix 3/4 cup sour cream with 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 teaspoon salt
1. Refrigerate until ready to use (30+ minutes, preferably)
