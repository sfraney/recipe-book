I have a great recipe for sous vide [pork shoulder chashu](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-make-pork-shoulder-chashu), but wasn't happy with the one pork belly chashu I'd made before. This recipe is based on [Kenji's "Chashu Pork" recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/chashu-pork-marinated-braised-pork-belly-for-tonkotsu-ramen-recipe) with minor modifications for sous vide (e.g., boil the marinade for a bit to burn off some alcohol - mostly from [here](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-japanese-ramen-chashu-pork-belly)) and ingredient substitutions.

## Ingredients

- 2 pound slab of boneless pork belly, skin-on
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup shaoxing wine (original: sake, but I didn't want to use the sake I brough back from Japan)
- 1 cup mirin
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3 small leeks from the garden, roughly chopped (original: 6 scallions)
- 6 whole garlic cloves
- 1 (2-inch) knob ginger, roughly sliced
- 1/2 medium white onion (original: whole shallot, split in half (skin on))

## Process

1. Lay pork belly on cutting board and roll up lengthwise, with skin facing out. 
1. Using butchers twine, tightly secure pork belly at 3/4-inch intervals. 
1. Set up sous vide to 158ÂºF
1. In a pot or saucepan bring marinade ingredients (everything except pork belly) to a boil to burn off the alcohol. Alcohol does not cook off well in the sous vide. Set aside to cool.
1. Place pork into a heavy duty vacuum bag. Pour cooking liquid into bag. Sous vide in water bath for 24 hours 
1. Cool in refrigerator, then slice - thin rounds for ramen, thicker if eating on its own. Sear in hot skillet on both sides.

## Impressions

Very good. Incredibly tender and well-seasoned. I reduced the marinade from the sous vide bag in case the meat wasn't flavorful enough, but it wasn't necessary.
