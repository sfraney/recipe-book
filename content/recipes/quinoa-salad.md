We got this recipe during our first CSA subscription in Madison, WI. We got a free subscription for a few weeks to a site that partnered with the CSA to come up with recipes for the week's boxes (Local Thyme). One week we got what we thought was an unreasonable amount of ginger, but turned out to be sunchokes. This recipe was meant to use these sunchokes, some garlic scapes, and spinach that were also in the box. It didn't seem too promising, but it was surprisingly very good. It's been a favorite (for at least 2 of the 3 in the family, anyway) ever since.

Since we don't usually have sunchokes or garlic scapes, this recipe uses carrots and granulated garlic, which work really well.

## Ingredients

- 3/8 cup Lemon Juice
- 2 teaspoons granulated garlic (alternately 1 stalk Green Garlic , trimmed of all except 1 inch of light green, finely minced)
- 1/2 teaspoon Sea Salt
- 3 teaspoons Dijon Mustard
- 3/4 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 3/4 pound Carrots (alternately Sunchoke, well scrubbed, and any discolored areas removed)
- 2 cup Quinoa
- 3 cups Vegetable Stock, or water
- 1/2 pound leafy green (e.g., spinach, kale)
- optional: 1/2 bunch Scallion
- optional, but we've never had it: 1/4 cup Pumpkin Seed, toasted

## Process

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, green garlic, salt, mustard and olive oil, until the vinaigrette emulsifies.
1. Using the large grating blade on a food processor, or a large box grater, grate the carrots or sunchokes. Toss into the bowl with the vinaigrette and chill in the fridge while prepping the other ingredients.
1. Dry toast your quinoa by stirring in it a saucepan over medium high heat until all the grains cease clinging to one another and they begin to smell nutty. Stir in the vegetable stock or water. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook covered for about 15-20 minutes, until the seeds have all popped and are tender.
1. Wash and drain the leafy green vegetable, and tear it into bite-sized pieces. Wash and trim the scallions and slice into 1/4 inch rounds. Reserve.
1. When quinoa is finished cooking, fluff with a fork, and spread it on a large dish to speed cooling.
1. After the quinoa has cooled, and the carrots/sunchokes are finished marinating, toss the quinoa in with sunchokes, stirring so the vinaigrette is well mixed into the quinoa. Fold in the spinach, scallions, and toasted pumpkin seeds. Adjust seasoning by adding more salt or pepper to taste. Serve room temperature or chilled.
