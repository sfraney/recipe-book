A recipe from ChatGPT for a single-dish meal using stuff from the fridge.

## Ingredients

- ~1.5 lb cooked chicken breast (sous vide to 149°F, chilled), sliced thin
- ~6 oz paneer, cubed
- 2–3 heads baby bok choy, halved or quartered
- 1 bunch Chinese celery, cut into 2–3 inch pieces
- 2–3 tsp ginger, julienned
- 2–3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fermented black beans, rinsed and chopped
- 1 tbsp soy sauce or tamari
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil (optional)
- 1–2 tbsp neutral oil (e.g., canola or avocado)

## Process

1. **Sear the paneer**:  
   In a nonstick or cast iron pan over medium heat, sear the paneer cubes in oil until golden-brown on most sides. Remove and set aside.

2. **Warm the chicken**:  
   Add the sliced, cooked chicken breast to the hot pan and sauté briefly until just warmed through. Don’t overcook—it’s already done. Remove and set aside.

3. **Stir-fry aromatics and vegetables**:  
   In the same pan, add a bit more oil if needed. Sauté garlic, ginger, and fermented black beans for ~30 seconds until fragrant.  
   Add bok choy and Chinese celery. Stir-fry for 2–4 minutes until crisp-tender.

4. **Combine and finish**:  
   Return chicken and paneer to the pan. Add 1 tbsp soy sauce and toss everything together. Add a splash of water if needed to help coat and steam.  
   Drizzle with sesame oil (optional) and serve hot, optionally over cauliflower rice.
