## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- **4 oz** dried black rice noodles
- **1 cup** fresh bean sprouts, rinsed and drained
- **1 cup** thinly sliced onion
- **1 cup** julienned carrot
- **1 cup** thinly sliced celery (on the bias)
- **1 cup** long beans, cut into 3-inch pieces
- **2 cloves** garlic, minced
- **1 tbsp** neutral oil (canola or grapeseed)
- **18–20 oz** bone-in, skinless chicken thighs (about 2 large)

### Low-Potassium Japchae Sauce
- **3 tbsp** reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
- **1 tbsp** toasted sesame oil
- **1 tbsp** rice vinegar
- **1 tsp** erythritol or allulose (or ½ tsp honey if tolerated)
- **1 tsp** grated ginger
- **1 tsp** sesame seeds (optional)
- **1–2 tbsp** water (to adjust saltiness and volume)

## Method

1. **Poach chicken**: Place thighs in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook 25–30 minutes until meat is cooked through and pulls from the bone easily. Remove chicken, cool slightly, then shred and discard bones. Reserve ¼ cup cooking liquid.

1. **Blanch long beans** *(optional but recommended)*: Boil long beans 1–2 minutes in the chicken water, drain, rinse in cold water to keep them bright.

1. **Cook noodles**: Boil black rice noodles in the chicken water per package instructions. Drain, rinse in cold water, and set aside.

1. **Mix sauce**: Combine tamari, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sweetener, ginger, sesame seeds, and water.

1. **Stir-fry vegetables**: Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high. Stir-fry onion and carrot 2 minutes. Add celery and long beans, stir-fry 2–3 minutes. Add garlic and bean sprouts, stir-fry 1 more minute.

1. **Combine**: Add shredded chicken, noodles, and sauce to the pan. Toss until hot and well coated, adding some reserved chicken broth if the noodles need more moisture.

1. **Serve**: Divide into 3 bowls, sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired.
