Trying to figure out what to make with a dearth of fresh vegetables and 2 lbs. of chicken thighs. This is what ChatGPT came up with that sounded interesting.

## Ingredients

- 2 lb bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- salt

### Vegetable salad

- 1 can heart of palm, drained and rinsed
- 1 can green beans, drained
- 1 cup oyster mushrooms, sliced
- 1 medium carrot, cut into thin matchsticks
- 2 celery stalks, thinly sliced
- 1/2 onion, thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, minced
- 1–2 tbsp neutral oil

### Warm vinaigrette

- 1 1/2 tbsp rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp oil
- salt to taste

## Process

### 1. Prep the chicken

Salt the chicken generously on both sides. Let sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.

### 2. Sear the heart of palm

Slice heart of palm lengthwise into planks or thick strips. Pat dry thoroughly.

Heat a skillet over medium-high with a thin film of oil. Add palm in a single layer. Sear undisturbed 2–3 minutes until lightly golden in spots. Turn and sear briefly on the other side.

Remove to a plate.

### 3. Cook the vegetables

Lower heat to medium. Add oil if the pan is dry.

Sauté onion, carrot, and celery 3–4 minutes until just tender. Add mushrooms and cook until they release moisture and it cooks off. Stir in garlic and ginger and cook 30 seconds.

Add green beans and return heart of palm to the pan. Toss to warm through. Turn off heat.

### 4. Dress the salad

Stir vinegar, mustard, oil, and salt directly into the hot pan. Toss to coat. Taste and adjust seasoning. Keep warm.

### 5. Cook the chicken

Heat an oven-safe skillet over medium. Place chicken skin-side down in a dry pan. Cook 8–10 minutes without moving until skin is deep golden and fat has rendered.

Flip and transfer to a 400°F oven for 10–15 minutes, until cooked through.

Rest 5 minutes.

### 6. Serve

Spoon the warm vegetable salad onto plates. Top with chicken. Add a small scoop of black rice + quinoa on the side if using.
