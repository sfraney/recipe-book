### Ingredients
- 2 cups cooked red rice (about ¾ cup uncooked)
- 1 block firm tofu, pressed and cubed (about 14 oz)
- 2 baby bok choy, chopped (leaves and stems separated)
- 1 cup button mushrooms, sliced
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 medium carrot, finely diced
- 1 celery stalk, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, minced
- 1 tablespoon tianjin fermented cabbage, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce (or to taste)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 3 eggs, beaten
- ½ teaspoon white pepper (optional)
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil (canola or avocado)
- ¼ cup crushed rice crackers or panko (optional topping)

### Instructions

1. Prepare the tofu  
   - Heat a nonstick or cast iron pan over medium-high heat with ½ tablespoon oil.  
   - Add tofu cubes and pan-sear until golden on most sides, about 8–10 minutes.  
   - Remove and set aside.

2. Cook the aromatics and vegetables  
   - In the same pan, add remaining oil, onion, garlic, and ginger. Sauté 1–2 minutes until fragrant.  
   - Add celery, carrot, and mushrooms; cook until softened, about 5 minutes.  
   - Stir in bok choy stems and cook another 2 minutes.  
   - Add fermented cabbage and soy sauce; mix well, then remove from heat.  
   - Fold in bok choy leaves to wilt with residual heat.

3. Combine the casserole mixture  
   - In a large bowl, mix cooked red rice, tofu, and the sautéed vegetables.  
   - Add sesame oil and white pepper; taste and adjust soy if needed.  
   - Stir in the beaten eggs until evenly coated.

4. Assemble and bake  
   - Lightly oil a 2-quart baking dish.  
   - Spread the mixture evenly and sprinkle crushed rice crackers (or panko) on top if using.  
   - Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25–30 minutes, until the egg is set and the top is lightly browned.

5. Serve  
   - Rest 5–10 minutes before slicing.  
   - Optionally drizzle a few drops of sesame oil or sprinkle chopped scallion tops (if tolerated).

### Flavor Notes
- Tianjin cabbage adds depth and salinity; additional salt is usually unnecessary beyond soy sauce.  
- Bok choy leaves steam into the mix, keeping the texture moist.  
- The baked egg binds the casserole for sliceable yet tender pieces.
