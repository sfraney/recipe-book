## Prep Components

### Clarify the Butter
1. Melt butter slowly over low heat.
2. Let it gently simmer. Foam will rise; milk solids will sink.
3. Skim off foam.
4. When the liquid fat is clear and golden and solids are lightly browned, remove from heat.
5. Carefully pour off the clear fat, leaving solids behind.

Set aside. This is your ghee.

### Make Cashew Cream
1. Cover raw cashews with hot water.
2. Soak 20–30 minutes.
3. Drain and blend with just enough fresh water to make a smooth, pourable cream.

Do not toast the cashews and do not make this thick like nut butter.

### If Using Yogurt: Temper It  
*(Skip this entirely if using cream.)*

1. Place yogurt in a bowl.
2. Whisk in 2–3 tablespoons of hot curry liquid once the curry is nearly finished.
3. When warm and loose, it is safe to add back to the pan.
