## Ingredients

- 5 lb pickling cucumber
- 1 T whole mustard seed, divided
- 1 t whole allspice
- 1 t whole juniper berries
- 1 t ground turmeric
- 1/2 t coriander seeds
- ~6 whole cloves
- 1/4 t ground ginger
- 1 bay leaf, crushed
- 1 small (1/2-inch) cinnamon stick, broken
- 1 whole star anise, broken into pieces
- 1/4 thinly-sliced white onion
- 4 cloves peeled garlic
- several heads of flowering dill and/or tufts
- 150 g pure salt (preferably kosher) for 5.25% brine
- 2 1/2 qt water
- 2 1/2 C white distilled vinegar (this is all we had)

## Process

1. Wash cucumbers, then trim off the flower-end (opposite of the stem) using a paring knife. Place cucumbers in a large bowl of ice water. Let stand while you prepare the spice mixture.
1. In a small bowl, stir together mustard seed with the allspice, juniper, turmeric, coriander, cloves, ground ginger, bay leaves, cinnamon, and star anise, if using. Measure out 1 tablespoon pickling spice blend and reserve the rest for a future batch.
1. Pack the sliced onion, garlic, dill, 1 tablespoon pickling spice, and remaining 1 tablespoon mustard seed into a jar, pressing firmly into the bottom.
1. In a medium bowl, stir together salt with water until salt is dissolved. Drain cucumbers and pack into the jar. Pour saltwater brine over cucumbers until covered. Close jar, fitting it with a Pickle Pipe or other airlock system for mason jars.
1. Place fermenting vessel in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight to ferment. Ideal fermentation temperature is 60° F (16° C) to 70° F (21° C). Dry basements are ideal as they maintain a relatively consistent temperature.
1. The exact fermentation time is hard to predict, but generally it takes about 3 weeks to reach the half-sour stage and 6 weeks to reach the full-sour stage. When your pickles reach your desired sourness level, transfer to the refrigerator. The finished pickles can be refrigerated for up to 2 months.
1. **Optional, but definitely do:** To make a Polish-style vinegar-fermented hybrid pickle, follow the recipe as written, adding 1 cup of white vinegar for every quart of water.

I started a batch of these today. I bought a total of 6 lbs. of cucumbers from two stalls at the farmers' market and a bunch of baby dill from the first stall. The total cost was ~$22. Here are the specific ingredients and process I used.

## Ingredients

- 6 lb pickling cucumber
- 2 T whole mustard seed, divided
- 2 t ground turmeric
- 1 t coriander seeds
- 10 whole cloves
- 1/2 t ground ginger
- 2 bay leaf, crushed
- 1 large (~1-inch) cinnamon stick, broken
- 2 whole star anise, broken into pieces
- 1/2 thinly-sliced, medium white onion
- 6 cloves peeled garlic
- several heads of dill tufts
- 125 g pure salt (preferably kosher) for 5.25% brine
- 2 1/2 qt water
- 3/4 C white distilled vinegar (this is all we had)

## Process

1. Wash cucumbers, then trim off the flower-end (opposite of the stem) using a paring knife. Place cucumbers in a large bowl of ice water as they are all cleaned. Once all cucumbers are cleaned, add generous dose of salt to cold water and mix to dissolve. This will help pull moisture out of the cucumbers. Let sit while preparing spice mixture.
1. In a small bowl, stir together mustard seed with the turmeric, coriander, cloves, ground ginger, bay leaves, cinnamon, and star anise.
1. Pack the sliced onion, garlic, dill, and pickling spice into a 5-L fermenting crock.
1. In a medium bowl, stir together salt with water until salt is dissolved. Drain cucumbers and pack into the jar. Pour saltwater brine over cucumbers until covered. Put lid on crock and fill water trough with sanitizing solution.
1. Place fermenting crock in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight to ferment. Ideal fermentation temperature is 60° F (16° C) to 70° F (21° C). Dry basements are ideal as they maintain a relatively consistent temperature.
1. The exact fermentation time is hard to predict, but generally it takes about 3 weeks to reach the half-sour stage and 6 weeks to reach the full-sour stage. When your pickles reach your desired sourness level, transfer to the refrigerator. The finished pickles can be refrigerated for up to 2 months.
