## Ingredients

- 150 g pure salt (preferably kosher) for 5.25% brine
- 5 lb pickling cucumber
- 1 T whole mustard seed, divided
- 1 t whole allspice
- 1 t whole juniper berries
- 1 t ground turmeric
- 1/2 t coriander seeds
- ~6 whole cloves
- 1/4 t ground ginger
- 1 bay leaf, crushed
- 1 small (1/2-inch) cinnamon stick, broken
- 1 whole star anise, broken into pieces
- 1/4 thinly-sliced white onion
- 4 cloves peeled garlic
- several heads of flowering dill and/or tufts
- 1 1/2 qt water

## Process

1. Wash cucumbers, then trim off the flower-end (opposite of the stem) using a paring knife.  Place cucumbers in a large bowl of ice water.  Let stand while you prepare the spice mixture.
1. In a small bowl, stir together mustard seed with the allspice, juniper, turmeric, coriander, cloves, ground ginger, bay leaves, cinnamon, and star anise, if using. Measure out 1 tablespoon pickling spice blend and reserve the rest for a future batch.
1. Pack the sliced onion, garlic, dill, 1 tablespoon pickling spice, and remaining 1 tablespoon mustard seed into a jar, pressing firmly into the bottom.
1. In a medium bowl, stir together salt with water until salt is dissolved. Drain cucumbers and pack into the jar. Pour saltwater brine over cucumbers until covered. Close jar, fitting it with a Pickle Pipe or other airlock system for mason jars.
1. Place fermenting vessel in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight to ferment. Ideal fermentation temperature is 60째 F (16째 C) to 70째 F (21째 C). Dry basements are ideal as they maintain a relatively consistent temperature.
1. The exact fermentation time is hard to predict, but generally it takes about 3 weeks to reach the half-sour stage and 6 weeks to reach the full-sour stage. When your pickles reach your desired sourness level, transfer to the refrigerator. The finished pickles can be refrigerated for up to 2 months.
1. **Optional, but definitely do:** To make a Polish-style vinegar-fermented hybrid pickle, follow the recipe as written, adding 1 cup of white vinegar for every quart of water.
