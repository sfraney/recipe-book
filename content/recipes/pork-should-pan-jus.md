## Ingredients

- 2.7 lb pork shoulder roast (boneless preferred; bone-in is fine)
- 1½ tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- 2–3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 cup chicken stock (or pork stock if you have it)
- Optional aromatics: 1 small onion or 2 shallots, roughly chopped

## Preparation

1. Pat the pork completely dry.

1. Salt evenly on all sides. Add pepper.

1. If you have time, let it sit uncovered in the fridge for 8–24 hours. If not, proceed immediately.

1. Preheat oven to 275°F.

1. Heat a heavy Dutch oven or roasting pan over medium-high with the oil.

1. Brown the pork well on all sides. Take your time here. This is where flavor is built.

1. Add garlic, thyme, bay, and optional onion/shallot around the meat.

1. Add stock to come about ½–¾ inch up the side of the roast.

1. Cover tightly (lid or foil) and transfer to the oven.

1. Roast 3½–4½ hours, until:
  - Internal temp is ~195–203°F, and
  - A fork twists easily with little resistance.

### Finish and Brown

1. Remove the pork and tent loosely with foil.

1. Increase oven to 425°F.

1. Return the pork uncovered to the oven for 20–30 minutes, rotating once, until deeply browned.

### Pan Jus

1. While the pork rests (at least 20 minutes), strain the pan liquid into a saucepan.

1. Skim excess fat.

1. Reduce over medium heat until lightly thickened and savory.

1. Taste and adjust salt. A splash of apple cider vinegar or lemon juice is optional but often helpful.
