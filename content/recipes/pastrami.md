From [AmazingRibs](https://amazingribs.com/tested-recipes/beef-and-bison-recipes/home-made-pastrami-thats-close-katzs-recipe/). This recipe tries to mimic the flavor of pastrami from Katz's deli.

## Ingredients

### For the Pastrami Rub
- 2 tablespoons black peppercorns, coarsely ground
- 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, coarsely ground
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder

### For the Pastrami
- 1 corned beef brisket (3-4 pounds)
- 1/4 cup yellow mustard
- Pastrami rub (above)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the rub**: Mix all rub ingredients together in a small bowl.

2. **Prep the brisket**: Remove corned beef from packaging and remove all of the fat cap and if there is any filmy membrane on the other side, remove it all.

3. **Apply mustard and rub**: Rinse the meat, and while it is damp, apply the rub liberally and press it into the surface to help it adhere.

4. **(Optional) Rest the meat**: Place the rubbed brisket on a wire rack over a baking sheet and refrigerate uncovered for 2-4 hours to allow the rub to set.

5. **Preheat smoker**: Set up your smoker for indirect cooking at 225°F. Wood choice doesn't make much difference with all the other flavors going on.

6. **Smoke the pastrami**: Place the brisket on the smoker, fat side up. Smoke until the internal temperature reaches 160°F to 165°F.

7. **Texas Crutch to finish**: Wrap the pastrami in aluminum foil and roast it until the internal temperature reaches 203°F.

8. **Rest and slice**: Let the pastrami rest for 30 minutes, then slice thinly against the grain for serving.

## Notes

- **Starting with corned beef**: This recipe assumes you're starting with ready-made corned beef (store-bought or homemade). For a complete from-scratch version, you'll need to cure the brisket first.
- **Finishing method**: You can finish in a 300°F oven.
- **Slicing**: Pastrami should be sliced very thinly, against the grain, about 1/8 inch thick for the best texture.
- **Storage**: Pastrami keeps well in the refrigerator for up to a week and freezes beautifully for up to 3 months.
- **Serving**: Perfect for sandwiches, hash, or as a main course with traditional deli sides.
