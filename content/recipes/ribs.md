## Ingredients

- 1 slab ribs any cut (baby back, spare ribs, St. Louis cut)
- 4 tablespoons [Meathead's Memphis Dust]({{< ref "memphis-dust" >}}) (see notes below if you would prefer to use our bottled pork rub)
- 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal Coarse Kosher Salt (1/2 teaspoon per pound of meat)
- 6 tablespoons barbecue sauce (optional)

## Process
1. Prep. Rinse the ribs in cool water to remove any bone bits from the butchering.

1. If the butcher has not removed the membrane from the under side, do it yourself.

1. Trim the excess fat from both sides of the rack of ribs.

1. Next it is time to add the salt. The rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon of diamond crystal kosher salt per pound of meat, but ribs are about 50% bone, so use about 1/2 teaspoon per pound.

1. Before applying the rub, just coat the meat with a thin layer of water. The water helps dissolve the spices. Once wet, sprinkle enough Meathead's Memphis Dust to coat all surfaces but not so much that the meat doesn't show through. That is about 2 tablespoons per side depending on the size of the slab. Spread the Memphis Dust on the meat and rub it in.

1. Fire up. Pre-heat your barbecue smoker or set up your grill for 2-zone (indirect) cooking. Adjust the dampers on your cooker to bring the temperature to about 225°F (107°C) and try to keep it there throughout the cook.

1. Once you have reached the desired temperature, add about 4 ounces (113 g) of dry wood, placing it as close to the flame as possible.

1. Cook. Put the slabs in the cooker in indirect heat, meaty side up, close the lid.

1. When the smoke dwindles after 20 to 30 minutes, add another 4 ounces (113 g) of wood. After that, DO NOT add any more wood.

1. If you have more than one slab on, halfway through the cook you will need to move the ribs closest to the fire away from the heat, and the slabs farthest from the flame in closer. Leave the meat side up. There is no need to flip the slabs.

1. This next step is known as the Texas Crutch. This optional trick involves wrapping the slab in foil with about an ounce of water for up to an hour to speed cooking and tenderize a bit.

1. For cooking time, allow 5 to 7 hours for St. Louis Cut (SLC) Ribs or Spare Ribs, and 3 to 5 hours for Baby Back Ribs. Thicker, meatier slabs take longer.

1. When it is time to find out whether or not the ribs are ready, we us the bend test (a.k.a. the bounce test). To conduct the bend test, pick up the slab with tongs and bounce it gently. If the surface cracks, it is ready.

1. Once the ribs are done cooking it is time to add the sauce unless you intend to serve them "dry" like they do in Memphis. The key to saucing ribs is to go easy on it so that the meat can shine through. Simply paint both sides of the rack with your favorite home made barbecue sauce or store-bought barbecue sauce and cook for another 15 minutes or so.  Don't put the sauce on earlier than that. It has sugar and there is a risk it can burn.

1. Serve. Once sauced, slice the rack between the bones. If you've done all this right, you will notice that there is a thin pink layer beneath the surface of the meat. It is the highly prized smoke ring caused by the combustion gases and the smoke.
