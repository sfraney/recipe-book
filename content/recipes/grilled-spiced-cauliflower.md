I don’t want to fire up the grill, so I’m using a grill recipe with Kenji’s guidance on roasting cauliflower. Except my oven’s still OOC, so a toaster oven at 450° F will have to do…

## Ingredients

For the Spice Mixture

- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons ground turmeric
- 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## For the Cauliflower

- 1 head of cauliflower, trimmed of green leaves and cut into 3/4-inch slices (see note)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems

## Process

1. Mix all spices together
1. Toss cauliflower with oil and season liberally with spice mixture
1. Roast cauliflower at 450°F until it’s browned and tender, flipping once during cooking
