Tonight, I collected a list of the CSA vegetables that we have sitting around and checked out the CSA's [recipe database](https://pumpkinridgegardens.com/ "Pumpkin Ridge Gardens").

The following recipes are presented in order of preparation. If made in this order, everything ends up being done at about the same time.

# Impressions

This was all really good and it used up a lot of vegetables. It took 3 hours or so from start to finish, though. I made sure to prep everything before hand (mise en place). I also did pretty well timing things.
