Based on Kenji’s potato hash in The Food Lab

## Ingredients

- ~5 medium potatoes (I’ve used russet & golden, so pretty flexible)
- 1/2 medium onion
- 4 – 5 cloves garlic
- 3 Eggs
- Hot sauce
- Salt & Pepper

## Process

1. Wash and chop potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes
1. Microwave potatoes for ~5 minutes on high, covered with wet paper towel (alternative is to boil for a few minutes)
1. Add ~2 T oil to oven-safe skillet, heat to lightly smoking
1. Add potatoes, stirring occasionally until browned on about 1/2 their sides
1. Preheat oven to 400°F
1. Add onion (and any other robust vegetables), stirring occasionally until charred in places
1. Add hot sauce & garlic (and any other less robust vegetables), stirring constantly until fragrant
1. Make 3 wells in the potatoes for eggs
1. Add eggs and place in oven
1. These can be staged if there are different egg preferences
1. To get proper eggs for my family (1 over hard, 1 over medium, 1 over easy) toaster oven at 400°F for 12, 8, and 4 minutes, respectively.
