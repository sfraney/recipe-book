## Impressions

First of all, it takes a few days to carbonate. The plastic bottle I was carbonating in (one from [Mr. Beer](https://www.mrbeer.com "Mr. Beer") kit) was still not carbonated enough when the sides were pretty firm (just a bit of deflection).

Strong ginger bite, but not more than [Q Ginger Beer](https://qmixers.com/our-mixers/ginger-beer/ "Q Ginger Beer"). It seemed really strong after cooling off the stove, but after some carbonation, it actually didn't seem too bad. It's a little too sweet though, so I think I'll take down the sugar a bit next time.
