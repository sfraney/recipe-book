Based on [Recipe seen on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/n94tq/as_promised_the_holy_grail_pizza_crust_food_porn/).

## Ingredients

- 3 C shredded cheese - mozzarella and cheddar
- 12 T ground almonds
- 1 egg

## Process

1. Melt the cheese in a microwave and add in the ground almonds and egg
1. Mix by hand when it cools enough
1. Spread thin in a frying pan and fry to a golden brown on both sides. Then into the fridge to cool right down.
1. After it is thoroughly cool add you toppings and cook it in the oven at 350 for a few minutes and broil for a bit more

## Impressions

Not great. I was the only one that ate more than a slice (to be fair, I made it for myself, but asked people to try). It was better than a recipe I found on [thekitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/almond-flour-pizza-crust-recipe-23199142#post-recipe-272700141), but it's not exactly great.

I think I may incorporate some leavening agent in the future to make it a little less dense and may try adding cream cheese as suggested [here](https://www.thekitchn.com/almond-flour-pizza-crust-recipe-23199142#post-recipe-272700141).
