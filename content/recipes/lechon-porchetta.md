We went to the Philippines just before Thanksgiving this year and saw what looked like porchetta - rolled pork belly with crisp skin - in several windows. Since turkey sucks, it seemed like a better idea to make this for the Thanksgiving table.

## Ingredients

- 3–4 lb pork belly, skin-on, butterflied to even thickness
- 1% weight of pork belly kosher salt (divided) [[1]](https://www.seriouseats.com/tips-for-seasoning-with-salt-11768648)[[2]](https://theblogjournal.com/how-much-salt-should-i-add-to-a-pound-of-meat/)
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 8–10 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium red onion or 3–4 shallots, thinly sliced
- 3–4 stalks lemongrass
- soy sauce (optional, for basting)
- 1–2 tbsp calamansi juice - key limes are a good substitute
- 1 tsp baking powder
- Kitchen twine

## Process

### Prepare lemongrass

1. Trim lemongrass to the bottom 4–6 inches; peel away tough outer layers.
1. Lightly bruise/smash each stalk with the flat of a knife to release oils.
1. Lay whole bruised stalks along the center of the meat when assembling. After roasting, pull them out and discard before slicing.

### Assembly

1. Pat skin very dry. Mix ~1/3 salt and baking powder together. Rub this mixture evenly over the entire skin surface. Allow ~30 minutes for salt to penetrate a bit.
1. Flip belly over and score the flesh side in a crosshatch pattern (about 1/4 inch deep) to increase surface area for seasoning and help the roll hold together.
1. Season meat side with remaining salt, pepper, garlic, calamansi juice, sliced onion, and lemongrass.
1. Roll tightly, skin outside, and tie in 4–6 places.

### Drying (recommended)
- Refrigerate uncovered at least 8 hours or overnight to dry the skin.

### Roasting

1. Preheat oven to 300°F. Place roll on a rack over a tray.
1. Roast 3–4 hours, basting occasionally with the pan drippings (optionally with soy sauce neat the end), until internal temp reads 165-170°F on an instant-read thermometer and pork shows very little resistance to a knife or skewer, aside from the outer layer of skin.
1. Increase oven to 475°F and roast 20–30 minutes until skin crisps and puffs. Rotate as needed for even color.

### Finish

- Rest at least 15 minutes. Remove the lemongrass stalks before slicing. Slice and serve.
