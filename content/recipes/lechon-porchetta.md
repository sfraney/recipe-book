We went to the Philippines just before Thanksgiving this year and saw what looked like porchetta - rolled pork belly with crisp skin - in several windows. Since turkey sucks, it seemed like a better idea to make this for the Thanksgiving table.

## Ingredients

- 3–4 lb pork belly, skin-on, butterflied to even thickness
- kosher salt (divided) - amounts in the steps
- 1 tbsp black pepper (divided)
- 8–10 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium red onion or 3–4 shallots, thinly sliced
- 3–4 stalks lemongrass
- 4–5 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1–2 tbsp calamansi juice (key limes are a good substitute)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- Kitchen twine

## Process

### Prepare lemongrass

1. Trim lemongrass to the bottom 4–6 inches; peel away tough outer layers.
1. Lightly bruise/smash each stalk with the flat of a knife to release oils.
1. Lay whole bruised stalks along the center of the meat when assembling. After roasting, pull them out and discard before slicing.

### Assembly

1. Score the flesh side of the pork belly in a crosshatch pattern (about 1/4 inch deep) to increase surface area for seasoning and help the roll hold together.
1. Season meat side with salt (~1% the weight of the belly[[1]](https://www.seriouseats.com/tips-for-seasoning-with-salt-11768648)[[2]](https://theblogjournal.com/how-much-salt-should-i-add-to-a-pound-of-meat/)), 2 tsp pepper, garlic, sliced onion, bay leaves, and lemongrass.
1. Roll tightly, skin outside, and tie in 4–6 places.
1. Pat skin very dry. Mix remaining salt, pepper, baking powder, calamansi juice, and soy sauce into a paste. Rub this mixture evenly over the entire skin surface.

### Drying (recommended)
- Refrigerate uncovered at least 8 hours or overnight to dry the skin.

### Roasting

1. Preheat oven to 300°F. Place roll on a rack over a tray.
1. Roast 2.5–3.5 hours until internal temp 165–175°F and meat is tender.
1. Increase oven to 475°F and roast 20–30 minutes until skin crisps and puffs. Rotate as needed for even color.

### Finish

- Rest 15 minutes. Remove the lemongrass stalks before slicing. Slice and serve.
