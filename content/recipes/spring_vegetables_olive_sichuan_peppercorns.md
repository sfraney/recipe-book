## Ingredients

### For the Green Vegetables:

- Kosher salt
- 8 ounces (225 g) asparagus, cut on a bias into 2-inch pieces
- 4 ounces (about 1 cup/120 g) shelled English peas or frozen peas, thawed
- 8 ounces (about 2 cups/225 g) sugar snap peas, split in half on a sharp bias

### For the Stir Fry:
- 3 tablespoons (45 ml) peanut, rice bran, or other neutral oil
- 4 ounces (120 g) shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, caps cut into ¼-inch slices
- 4 small hot dried chiles (such as árbol or Japones), stems removed, snipped into ½-inch pieces with kitchen shears
- 1 teaspoon (2 g) Sichuan peppercorns
- ¼ cup (about 3 ounces/80 g) pitted kalamata or other black olives, minced
- 1 tablespoon (7.5 g) minced garlic (about 3 medium cloves)
- 1 tablespoon (7.5 g) minced fresh ginger (about ¾-inch segment)
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) light soy sauce or shoyu
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) Chinkiang or balsamic vinegar

## Process

1. For the Green Vegetables: Bring a couple quarts of heavily salted water to a boil in a wok. Add the asparagus, peas, and sugar snap peas and cook for 1 minute. Drain the vegetables and transfer to a couple of large plates or a rimmed baking sheet. Spread into a single layer and let the vegetables air-dry and cool while you prepare the remaining ingredients.
1. For the Stir-Fry: Heat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of the oil and swirl to coat. Add the mushrooms and stir-fry until spotty brown and crisp in spots, about 1 minute. Transfer to the tray with the green vegetables.
1. Return the wok to high heat until smoking. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons (30 ml) oil and swirl to coat. Immediately add the dried chiles and Sichuan peppercorns and cook until aromatic, about 10 seconds. Immediately add the olives, garlic, and ginger and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Return the mushrooms and vegetables to the wok and toss to combine. Swirl in the soy sauce and vinegar around the edge of the wok and toss to combine. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.
