## Ingredients

- 230g all-purpose flour
- 4 tsp sugar
- Kosher salt 
- 150g butter, cubed 
- 55ml cold water
- 2 leek, sliced
- 3 Tbsp butter, melted
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup half & half
- 2 Tbsp fresh dill, chopped
- Salmon of choice (to top the quiche)

## Process

1. In a food processor combine flour, sugar, and a pinch of kosher salt. Pulse until thoroughly combined before adding in cubed butter. 
1. Pulse the mixture together until it resembles coarse breadcrumbs then dump it out into a large bowl and top with cold water. 
1. Gently toss together using fingers and a wooden spoon until it starts to clump together, at which point turn it out onto a non floured surface and knead until a cohesive ball of dough is formed. 
1. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, ideally 2 hours. 
1. Remove the dough from the fridge onto a well-floured surface. Pound it out with a rolling pin and then roll it out until it’s 6 millimeters thick.
1. Unravel the crust onto a 9” tart pan then gently lift and drop the dough, pressing into the corners, trimming off the edges, and leaving a 1” overhang. Dock the dough using a fork. Line with aluminum foil and fill with pie weight of choice. 
1. Place into a 375°F oven for 30 minutes, then trim off most of the overhang. Place back into the oven for another 10 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool completely on a wire rack.
1. For the filling, cut 1 leek in half and thinly slice before sautéing in 1 ½ tablespoon of melted butter for about 10 minutes, tossing frequently and cover if necessary until nice and soft, but not brown. 
1. For the egg filling, in a large bowl goes 2 large eggs, ½ cup of half & half, and 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh dill. 
1. Beat together before adding in the cooled cooked leek slices, season with freshly ground pepper, and a generous pinch of kosher salt before mixing gently. 
1. Pour the mixture into the bottom of the prepared tart crust. Place into a 375°F oven for 20-25 minutes. The center should firm to the touch yet still jiggly. Let cool completely on a wire rack. 
1. Cut strips of salmon and lay them on top of the quiche.
